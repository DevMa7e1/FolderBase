# FolderBase
This is a python library that aims to simplify making, writing and reading files safely.
# Commands
There are only three commands:write(), read() and ishere(). Most of them are self explanatory, but, ishere() may seem a little weird. The command ishere() will check for the existance of a key in the database, also, read() does kind of the same. When you read, the function will return false if the key doesn't exist.
