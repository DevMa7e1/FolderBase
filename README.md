# FolderBase
This is a python library that is ready to cover all your database needs easily and efficienlty. To start, you will need to go in your project folder and create a new directory called folderbase for the library to work properly. Move the file folderbase.py in the main, project folder and the rest is up to you. Check the wiki for examples and uses.
# Commands
There are only three commands:write(), read() and ishere(). Most of them are self explanatory, but, ishere() may seem a little weird. The command ishere() will check for the existance of a key in the database, also, read() does kind of the same. When you read, the function will return false if the key doesn't exist.
